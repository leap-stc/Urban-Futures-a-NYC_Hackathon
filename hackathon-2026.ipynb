    "## 7) Writing outputs to `leap-scratch` (GCS): the safe writable workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways outputs can end up in `leap-scratch`: writing directly to `leap-scratch` and moving files from home directory to `leap-scratch`. The first method is strongly preferred.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7B) First Method: Write outputs directly to `leap-scratch`\n",
    "\n",
    "Most outputs (tables, model results, derived datasets) are created **in memory** as Python objects.  \n",
    "The safest and most efficient approach is to **write them directly to `leap-scratch`** without saving them locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: write a Pandas DataFrame to `leap-scratch`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "import gcsfs\n",

    "### 7C) Second Method: Move or copy files from home directory to `leap-scratch`\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes a file already exists locally (ex: a plot image or a file created by a tool that writes to disk).  \n",
    "In that case, you can **copy** the file from your home directory into `leap-scratch`.\n",
